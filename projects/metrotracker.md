# Metro Transit vehicle tracker #
This is a map tracking the current location of all running Metro Transit
vehicles. Each marker denotes a single vehicle. It takes thirty seconds to figure
out the direction of movement for each vehicle. After this time it displays an
approximated path of the vehicle delayed by thirty seconds.
