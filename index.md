# Hi there! #

My name is Kevin Schiroo. I'm a computer scientist living in the Twin Cities.
I've done a lot of things. I've worked as a data scientist with the
[Wiki Education Foundation](http://wikiedu.org), a graduate research assistant
with [Grouplens](http://grouplens.org) at the University of Minnesota, and a
software engineer working on the Power Hypervisor at IBM.

My current technical interests focus on open data. I like finding it,
gathering it, and analyzing it. I've specifically taken an interest in
local data. We live in a global society now, but somewhere along the
way I think we collectively forgot how big the world right next to us
still is.
